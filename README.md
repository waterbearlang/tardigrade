# Waterbear

Waterbear is a friendly block-based programming language. It has been around at [waterbearlang.com](https://waterbearlang.com/) for some time in experimental form. This is an attempt to fix longstanding issues with that version and push it for a 1.0 release.

NOTE: This is a very early stage work in progress. See the link above for a working version.
